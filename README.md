# Tunnelbroker IPv6-Proxy Installer

A simple shell script for deploying your owns IPv6 proxies via tunnelbroker.

# How it works

The script establishes 6to4 tunnels. You connect to your server's ipv4 address on a specific port and output one of the ipv6 addresses from your subnet.

## Features

-   Supported networks: `/48`, `/64`
-   Connection protocols: `http(s)` / `socks5`
-   Authentication by username and password (or w/o auth)
-   Custom port numbering (from start)
-   Simultaneous online over 60000 proxies
-   Minor resource usage (1000 online proxies = ~ 50mb ram)
-   Auto generating tunnels list

# Installation

```
sudo bash -c "$(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sellbywords/tunnelbroker-ipv6/main/main.sh)"
```

# How to start

0. Create account on https://tunnelbroker.net
1. Prepare your own server with a Debian based os. It's much better if you only use the server for your proxies and nothing more, because this script changes some system configurations that may affect your other applications. Cheap VPS servers are a great choice. There is no guarantee that the script will work with your cloud provider. For example, it does not work with Vultr. I have tested several cloud providers and had no problems using them, now I have settled on [Hetzner](https://hetzner.cloud/?ref=u773sH3Kq8gw).
2. [Create Regular Tunnel](https://tunnelbroker.net/tunnel_detail.php?tid=762030#:~:text=Create%20Regular%20Tunnel)
3. Install the script on your server with [one simple command](https://github.com/Sadzurami/tunnelbroker-proxies/blob/main/README.md#installation)
4. After installation, the server will be rebooted
5. The list of tunnels is located in your home directory (~/tunnels.txt)
